This program was made on Windows. I did not use anything that I think is operating system specific though.

This program can be run by using "python Server.py" in a terminal to start the server. The client can be opened seperately the same way but with Client.py
Both programs use localhost as the ip, so no ip address configuration or anything should be necessary.
